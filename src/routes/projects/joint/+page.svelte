	<Header>Cycle Freedom</Header>
	<Paragraph>
		Cycle is a yearly entrepreneurship camp in Lithuania. It is extremely practical and
		workshop-oriented, and teaches not only business skills, but most of all entrepreneurial
		thinking.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		It is founded and run by a group of successful international businessmen, who have built their
		businesses from scratch, and are sharing their experience with the next generation of
		entrepreneurs. The knowledge is free of charge, the participants only have to pay for food and
		lodging at an inexpensive resort in Lithuania, and cover their travel costs.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		The philosophy of Cycle Freedom is that financial freedom is a key component of personal
		freedom, and that entrepreneurship is the best way to achieve it. This is a perspective that we
		deeply share.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		Thriving Individuals are proud to support the camp, promoting it, and sending our members every
		year to help them accelerate their wealth creation journeys.
